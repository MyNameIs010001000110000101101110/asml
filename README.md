# ASML
Skin Lesion Image Segmentation Using Delaunay Triangulation for Melanoma Detection (ASML) is a fast and fully-automatic algorithm for skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images. Delaunay Triangulation is used to extract a binary mask of the lesion region, without the need of any training stage. The proposed approach is highly accurate when dealing with benign lesions, while the detection accuracy significantly decreases when melanoma images are segmented.
